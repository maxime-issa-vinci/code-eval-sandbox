## Project Overview

The platform allows users to submit code, track execution status, and retrieve results and logs through REST APIs, while an interactive React dashboard displays results, detailed logs, and evaluation scores.  
Designed with a microservices architecture, Docker containerization, and cloud deployment in mind, this project demonstrates expertise in backend development, full-stack integration, containerization, security best practices, and cloud scalability.  

## Key Features:

- Microservices backend with Spring Boot + Security to handle authentication, authorization, and code submissions.

- REST APIs for submitting programs, tracking execution, and retrieving results.

- Minimal React dashboard to submit code and visualize results and logs.

- Docker containers to isolate programs and ensure safe execution.

- Planned deployment on Kubernetes in AWS for stable and secure execution, while keeping setup simple.
